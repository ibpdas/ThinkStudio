## 1. Overview

Think Studio is a micro lab for public sector teams working on data strategy.  
It accelerates the most time consuming part of strategic work: making priorities explicit, surfacing organisational tensions and converting them into actionable plans and capabilities.

It is for leaders who need clarity fast, without lengthy frameworks or abstract best practice.

## 2. Stats at a glance

| Challenge | Figure | Insight | Source |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Data programme delays | 80% | Often caused by unclear priorities and fragmented ownership | NAO: Improving Government Data (2022) |
| Leaders lacking shared maturity view | 60%+ | Many teams struggle to articulate their real starting point | Cabinet Office DDaT Capability Survey (2023) |
| Initiatives with sustained impact | 1 in 3 | Most fail at alignment, not technology | NAO: Digital Transformation in Government |
| Time spent recreating alignment material | 40% | Teams repeatedly rebuild scans, matrices and summaries | NAO case examples and departmental interviews |
| Teams struggling to convert insight to priorities | 50% | Decision clarity is the limiting factor | Cross-government Strategy and Delivery Reviews |
| Blockers caused by organisational tension | 70%+ | Culture, incentives and governance outweigh technology | NAO, DDaT Workforce Insights, OECD Digital Government Review |

## 3. What Think Studio does

One integrated micro lab built around five modules, each with a clear analytical scope.

| Module     | What it covers                               | Quantified scope                                                           |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Explore**  | Scan peer materials and context              | 14 strategies, 5 filters, optional AI semantic search                 |
| **Diagnose** | Priorities, leader questions, maturity       | 6 maturity themes, 6–8 diagnostic prompts               |
| **Shift**    | Movement, tensions and direction of travel   | 10 strategic tensions, gap and conflict analysis |
| **Action**   | Projects, owners and impact                  | 9 project attributes, 1 action log, impact dashboard, CSV export           |
| **Research** | Skills, behaviours and development           | 10 frameworks, 7 behaviours, CSV export              |

## 4. How it works

Think Studio brings together:

- a guided flow from context to action  
- transparent and interpretable calculations  
- dynamic charts for tensions and maturity  
- editable project and impact tables  
- optional AI semantic search for scanning materials  

The principle is simple: clarity first, action second.

## 5. Use cases

Think Studio is used by public sector leaders, chiefs of staff, analysts and delivery teams to:

- prepare or refresh a data strategy  
- run 60–90 minute workshops with senior stakeholders  
- build alignment across digital, data, policy and operations  
- test ambition against maturity and organisational constraints  
- identify three to five priority shifts for a roadmap  
- anchor discussions in evidence rather than opinion  

It works especially well at programme startup.

## 6. What Think Studio is not

Think Studio is not:

- an official maturity assessment  
- a benchmarking tool comparing named organisations  
- a black-box generator of recommendations  
- a replacement for governance, judgement or delivery discipline  

It is a facilitation and alignment tool.
