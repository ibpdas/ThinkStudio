# How to Write a Public-Sector Data Strategy

## Purpose
A data strategy helps a public-sector organisation:
- Clarify how data delivers mission outcomes
- Set standards for quality, ethics, and interoperability
- Align investment and people capability
- Build trust and transparency

---

## Recommended Structure

### 1. Vision & Purpose
- Plain English statement of why data matters to the mission  
- Connection to government priorities (e.g., economic growth, net zero)

### 2. Context & Drivers
- Policy background (*A blurptint for modern digital government* etc.)  
- Key challenges and opportunities

### 3. Principles
- e.g., Open by default; Secure by design; Ethical by default; QFAIR (Quality–Findable–Accessible–Interoperable–Reusable)

### 4. Strategic Pillars

| Pillar | Example Focus |
|--------|----------------|
| Governance & Trust | Roles, ownership, metadata, standards |
| Skills & Culture | Literacy, training, communities of practice |
| Technology & Infrastructure | Interoperability, APIs, cloud, catalogues |
| Data Use & Value | Evidence based policy, AI readiness, service design |
| Ethics & Assurance | Risk, compliance, transparency |

### 5. Delivery Plan
- Time-bound actions (2–4-year horizon)  
- Who owns what (RACI or federated map)  
- Dependencies (digital, HR, finance)

### 6. Measurement
- Metrics across value, cost, time, reliability, reuse  
- Maturity model baseline and targets

### 7. Governance
- Steering arrangements, Data Board, link to Digital Strategy  
- Oversight model (central / federated / hybrid)

### 8. Implementation & Review
- Delivery roadmap (phases, checkpoints)  
- Annual review cycle

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|----------|-----|
| Too technical; unreadable by leaders | Lead with purpose, not platforms |
| Vague “data is an asset” language | Tie to measurable outcomes |
| No delivery accountability | Assign owners and milestones |
| Treating AI separately from data | Integrate as “AI-ready data” |
| Ignoring culture and capability | Include training, comms, incentives |
